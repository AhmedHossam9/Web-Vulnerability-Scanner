# Web-Vulnerability-Scanner

Web applications play a crucial role in facilitating the exchange of both services and data. However, as individuals increasingly rely on these different web applications to handle their variety of tasks, the security risks asscoiated to these applications continue to grow consistently. Considering the fact that web applications are inherently connected to the internet, protecting and ensuring one's private information is secure becomes a matter of utmost importance. Different kinds of cyberattacks pose a significant threat to both the integrity and confidentiality of any kind of information processed or stored. Our project is motivated by shortcomings observed in existing security tools. A prevalent issue is the high incidence of false alarms, inaccurately signaling problems. Additionally, these scanners often miss real issues due to their scanning approach. Our project aims to create an enhanced version of web security scanners, addressing issues like false alarms and missed vulnerabilities through effective scanning methods..
